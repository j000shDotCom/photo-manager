# Photo Manager

Visual layer for presenting and managing photo duplicates using hashes from
[Photo Deduplicator](https://github.com/j000shDotCom/photo-deduplication)

## Dependencies

Okay, not gonna lie ... I kinda just searched for trendy Javascript libraries and `yarn add`ed them.
This [TypeScript React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) setup page has
been instrumental in the decision to choose the following libraries.

- yarn
- react
-

```shell
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

## Objectives

- [ ] read database
- [ ] establish websocket connections to receive realtime photo pushes
- [ ] React Native app?
- [ ] Push test screenshots to Percy!
- [ ] React + TypeScript ... Redux??
